### Solution

You cannot bet more than you have, but you can bet negative number (for example -99999999) and that will make you a milionaire after round ends (and you lose) due to


```C
if(player_total<dealer_total) //If player's total is less than dealer's total, loss
      {
         printf("\nDealer Has the Better Hand. You Lose.\n");
         loss = loss+1;
         cash = cash - bet;
         printf("\nYou have %d Wins and %d Losses. Awesome!\n", won, loss);
         dealer_total=0;
         askover();
      }
```
