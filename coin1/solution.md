### Analysis

The challenge involves finding a counterfeit coin among a set of coins using a scale. The counterfeit coin weighs 9 units, while real coins weigh 10 units. You are given `N` coins and `C` chances to weigh subsets of coins to identify the counterfeit one. The goal is to find 100 counterfeit coins within 60 seconds.

### Exploit

To solve this efficiently, we use a **binary search approach**:
1. **Divide the coins into two halves** and weigh one half.
2. If the total weight is less than expected (i.e., `10 * number of coins`), the counterfeit coin is in that half.
3. Repeat the process until the counterfeit coin is found.

This approach ensures that the counterfeit coin is found within `log2(N)` weighings, which is optimal.

### Solution Code

```python
from pwn import *

def find_counterfeit(p):
    # Read parameters
    params = p.recvline().decode().split()
    N = int(params[0].split('=')[1])
    C = int(params[1].split('=')[1])

    # Binary search range
    left = 0
    right = N - 1

    while C > 0:
        C -= 1
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        # Weigh coins from left to mid
        to_weigh = list(range(left, mid + 1))
        expected_weight = len(to_weigh) * 10

        p.sendline(' '.join(map(str, to_weigh)).encode())
        weight = int(p.recvline().decode().strip())

        # Adjust search range based on weight
        if weight < expected_weight:
            right = mid  # Counterfeit is in the left half
        else:
            left = mid + 1  # Counterfeit is in the right half

        # If left == right, we've found the counterfeit
        if left == right:
            p.sendline(str(left).encode())
            result = p.recvline().decode()
            if result.startswith('Correct'):
                return True

    return False

def main():
    try:
        # Connect to the server
        p = remote('pwnable.kr', 9007)
        print(p.recv().decode())  # Print the initial message

        # Solve 100 times
        for _ in range(100):
            if not find_counterfeit(p):
                print("Failed to find counterfeit within allowed chances")
                break

        # Print the final result
        print(p.recv().decode())
        p.close()
    except Exception as e:
        print('Error:', e)
        p.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
