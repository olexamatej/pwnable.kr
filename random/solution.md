### Analysis

The program generates a "random" number using `rand()` and compares the XOR of this number with a user-provided `key` to `0xdeadbeef`. If the comparison succeeds, the program prints the flag. However, the `rand()` function is not seeded, so it always produces the same sequence of numbers. This makes the "random" number predictable.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
        unsigned int random;
        random = rand();        // random value!

        unsigned int key=0;
        scanf("%d", &key);
        printf("%d",random);
        if( (key ^ random) == 0xdeadbeef ){
                printf("Good!\n");
                system("/bin/cat flag");
                return 0;
        }

        printf("Wrong, maybe you should try 2^32 cases.\n");
        return 0;
}

```
### Exploit

1. **Predictable Random Number**:
   - Since `rand()` is not seeded, it always generates the same number (`1804289383` in this case).
   - We can calculate the required `key` by XORing the predictable random number with `0xdeadbeef`.

2. **Calculate the Key**:
   - Use the formula: `key = random_number ^ 0xdeadbeef`.

### Solution Code

```python
# Known values
answer = 0xdeadbeef
random_number = 1804289383  # Predictable random number from unseeded rand()

# Calculate the key
key = answer ^ random_number
print(f"The key is: {key}")
```

### Final Command

Run the following Python script to calculate the key and then provide it as input to the program:

```bash
python3 calculate_key.py
```

Then, run the program and input the calculated key:

```bash
./random
# Input the key when prompted
```
